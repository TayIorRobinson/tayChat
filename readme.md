# tayChat (beta)

[![build](https://github.com/TayIorRobinson/tayChat/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/TayIorRobinson/tayChat/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## [Visit the test place](https://www.roblox.com/games/7539728442/tayChat)

A modern chat UI for the Roblox chat system. Not fully complete yet, so expect bugs, bad code & missing features (but if you find them, please do tell!)

Built with Roact & roblox-ts.

## Features:

 - **Compatible**: tayChat is a drop-in replacement for the default Roblox chat GUI, implementing many of the same remote events and features, therefore features   as Player.Chatted, StarterGui:SetCore will work with this script, with other modifications.
 - **Modern**: Provides a more modern, bubble based look and feel.
 - **Formatting**: Supports a markdown-like syntax (\*\*bold\*\*, \*italic\*, \_\_underline\_\_, \~\~strikethrough\~\~, \`monospace\`) for formatting text. 
 - **Client only**: Due to the script piggie-backing on the Roblox chat system, this is a drop in replacement, on the client. (A server script will be required to provide typing statuses.)

## Todo:
- [ ] Typing indicator
- [ ] More animations
- [ ] Autocomplete
- [ ] Better command infrastructure
- [ ] Indicate filtered messages before send.

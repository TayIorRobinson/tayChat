# tayChat

A modern chat UI for the Roblox chat system.

Built with Roact & roblox-ts.

## Features:

    - **Compatible**: tayChat is a drop-in replacement for the default Roblox chat GUI, implementing many of the same remote events and features, therefore features such as Player.Chatted, StarterGui:SetCore will work with this script, with other modifications.
    - **Modern**: Provides a more modern, bubble based look and feel.
    - **Formatting**: Supports a markdown-like syntax (\*\*bold\*\*, \*italic\*, \_\_underline\_\_, \~\~strikethrough\~\~, \`monospace\`) for formatting text. 
    - **Client only**: Due to the script piggie-backing on the Roblox chat system, this is a drop in replacement, on the client. (A server script is required to provide typing statuses.)
